## UX
### Project Planning
During the project ideation stage, I restricted my point of reference to close friends and family as I was keen to build a website which would fulfill a real need for someone close to me. Discussions left me with three viable options - redesign my church website, design and develop a dedicated website for publishing stories, or design and develop a dedicated website for a cleaning business, The Cleaning Hack. 

All three options were considered in relation to existing technologies and potential alternatives. I chose the option to create a dedicated website for The Cleaning Hack. I decided this choice would be most advantageous overall as it would enhance the business owner's ability to market their services and broaden their reach, utimately contributing to their growth and success.

### Strategy Plane
#### User
As a user I want to be able to find a reliable cleaner in my area to clean my house.

As a user I want to be able to contact the user via email or phone.

As a user I want to be able to request a quote online.

As a user I want to be able to see the price before booking an appointment.

As a user I want to be able to see evidence of previous work.

As a user I want to be able to read or hear from other people that have used this cleaner.

As a user I want to be able to find out when the business is open.

##### Contact Page

The features and flow of this website are intended to showcase a minimalist design with a focus on accessible information regarding The Cleaning Hack's offerings and a format which is effective on all devices.

As the project took shape, the initial design as shown in the wireframes was adjusted and re-adjusted to prioritise key requirements for a functional project, and for delivery within the allocated time frame.

### Surface Plane
#### Colour
As the website was for an existing business I decided to stick with the existing colour scheme; different hues of blue.

### Typography
The fonts chosen for this project were:
- Fira Sans Condensed
- San-serif

I wanted to match existing styles as much as possible, and prioritise accessibility needs without distractions.

## Future Features
### About Page
I would enhance the 'About' page through the inclusion of a section about the CEO. It would include a photo and brief background into the owner and how The Cleaning Hack got started.

### Services Page
I would like to introduce more animation and images on the 'Services' page.

### Testimonials
I would like to add card animation so that when visitors hover over client reviews, a before and after photo showcasing the particular work carried out for the client is displayed.

### Contact Us
I would like to develop and integrate a backend for the contact form to capture prospects details and improve on lead generation for the business. 

I would also like to add a WhatsApp option so prospects can send instant messages for a quicker response. 

### Additional Page Ideas
I would like to develop and integrate a cleaning calculator specifically for prospects with residential enquiries so that they can obtain an estimate of how much it would cost based on the size of their property.

## Deployment
To deploy the project I followed these steps starting from the main project repository linked above.

 1. Clicked on `Settings` on the navigation menu in the repository
 2. I then selected the `Pages` menu on the side bar.
 3. In the first dropdown menu labeled `Source` I selected the branch of the name `main` from the dropdown.
 4. In the next dropdown labeled `/root` I left as the default option.
 5. Selected Save.
 
I then received a notification from GitHub that my project is being deployed and after about 2 minutes and a couple of refreshes of the page it was ready and live.
