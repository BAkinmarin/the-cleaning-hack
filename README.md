## UX
### Project Planning
During the project ideation stage, I limited my focus to friends and family as I was keen to build a website which would fulfill a real need. Discussions left me with three viable options - a do-over of my church website, a website for my sister to publish her stories, or a website for my partners current cleaning business. 

All three options were considered in relation to existing technologies and alternatives. There is already a website for my church, there currently exist a host of platforms my sister can and publishes her work however, my partner does not have a separate website dedicated to her business hence I went with this option. 

### Strategy Plane

### Surface Plane
#### Color
As the website was for an existing business I decided to stick with the existing color scheme of different hues of blue.

### Typography
The fonts chosen for this project were:
- Fira Sans Condensed
- San-serif

I wanted to match the existing styles as much as possible, with a focus on accessibility needs without distractions.

## Deployment
To deploy the project I followed these steps starting from the main project repository linked above.

 1. Clicked on `Settings` on the navigation menu in the repository
 2. I then selected the `Pages` menu on the side bar.
 3. In the first dropdown menu labeled `Source` I selected the branch of the name `main` from the dropdown.
 4. In the next dropdown labeled `/root` I left as the default option.
 5. Selected Save.
 
I then received a notification from GitHub that my project is being deployed and after about 2 minutes and a couple of refreshes of the page it was ready and live.
