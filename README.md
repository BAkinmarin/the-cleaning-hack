## UX
### Project Planning
During the project ideation stage, I limited my focus to friends and family as I was keen to build a website which would fulfill a real need. Discussions left me with three viable options - a do-over of my church website, a website for my sister to publish her stories, or a website for my partners current cleaning business. 

>All three options were considered in relation to existing technologies and alternatives. There is already a website for my church, there currently exist a host of platforms my sister can and publishes her work however, my partner does not have a separate website dedicated to her business hence I went with this option. 

### Strategy Plane

#### User
>As a user I want to be able to find a reliable cleaner in my area to clean my house. 
As a user I want to be able to contact the user via email or phone. 
As a user I want to be able to request a quote online. 
As a user I want to be able to book an appointment online.
As a user I want to be able to see the price. 
As a user I want to be able to see evidence of previous work. 
As a user I want to be able to read or hear from other people that have used this cleaner. 
As a user I want to be able to find out when the business is open.
As a user I want to be able to view social media accounts.

#### Business Owner

## Features
- Navigation Bar
    - Fully responsive navigation bar on all pages.
    - The navigation bar is large enough to be clickable on smaller devices and provide easy transition between various pages without the need of the 'back' browser button.

>Place screenshot of landing page here

- The Landing Page
    - The landing page includes a hero image with the Company slogan and two call to action buttons, 'Book Now' and 'Enquire Now'.
    - The 'Book Now' button is a convenient way of existing customers to schedule a deep clean visit with the Cleaning Hack or amend an existing booking. It is also handy for visitors who are less interested in perusing the contents of each page and just need a quote or wanting to ask questions.
